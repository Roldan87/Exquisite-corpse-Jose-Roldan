# The Neverending Story vol 17

*If today was your last day* and tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past, donate every dime you have? *If today was your last day*

Well that's all doom and gloom. I rather aim for the moon!
Whatever dime I have, have it, it is yours.
For all I wish, is to spend my final waking moments one with nature.

I would take all my money and climb a mountain no other climbers think about. 
At the top, I would throw the money in the air. Who will find it? I don't care. 
 
I am tall but not so tall.
I am big but not so big.
I am smart but, but no but.


I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
