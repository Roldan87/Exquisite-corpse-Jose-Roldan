# The Neverending Story vol 17

*If today was your last day* and tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past, donate every dime you have? *If today was your last day*

Well that's all doom and gloom. I rather aim for the moon!
Whatever dime I have, have it, it is yours.
For all I wish, is to spend my final waking moments one with nature.
