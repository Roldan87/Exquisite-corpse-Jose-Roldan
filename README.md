# The Neverending Story vol 17

*If today was your last day* and tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past, donate every dime you have? *If today was your last day*

Well that's all doom and gloom. I rather aim for the moon!
Whatever dime I have, have it, it is yours.
For all I wish, is to spend my final waking moments one with nature.

every day, every minute and every second can be your last. 
Worrying about if and when will get you nowhere. accepting you can't change it and living the best you can now, is all you can do. 
take the chanches you can and don't be affraid of discomfort see what is out there.
